## Introduction

Learning and implementing algorithms is a crucial aspect of computer science and data science. This repository is a personal journey to explore various algorithms, understand their principles, and implement them in different programming languages.

## Algorithms Covered

Some of the key algorithms to cover in this repository. For example:
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming problems (e.g., Knapsack Problem)

Feel free to expand this list as you progress.
